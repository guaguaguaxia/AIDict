### 小故事
Imagine you’re a university student in China, passionate about environmental conservation. Your campus plans to build a new parking lot, which would destroy a small green space where students relax. You feel torn: you want to resist this plan to protect the environment, but you’re nervous about speaking out. At a student council meeting, you decide to resist the proposal by presenting a petition signed by 200 students, arguing that the green space is vital for mental health and biodiversity. Your courage inspires others, and the university agrees to reconsider the plan.

### 挑战

## Step 8: 个性化建议

As a Chinese learner of English aiming to deeply understand vocabulary, here are tailored suggestions to master “resist”:

1. **Contextual Practice**: Since you’re interested in nuanced meanings, create a “resist journal.” Each day, note one instance where you resisted something (e.g., procrastination, a purchase, or a rule). Write a sentence using “resist” and categorize it under one of the three meanings (oppose, refrain, withstand). This will help you internalize the word’s versatility.
2. **Collocation Focus**: You emphasized collocations, so memorize key phrases like “resist temptation,” “resist change,” and “resist damage.” Practice these in sentences relevant to your life (e.g., “I resisted the temptation to scroll through WeChat during class”). Use apps like Anki to reinforce these pairings.
3. **Cultural Connection**: Given your Chinese background, explore how “resist” applies to historical events like the May Fourth Movement, where students resisted foreign influence and traditional norms. This cultural lens can make the word more memorable.
4. **Mnemonic Aid**: Create a visual mnemonic: imagine a wall resisting a storm (physical), a person saying “no” to a cookie (temptation), and a protester holding a sign (opposition). This mental image can anchor the word’s meanings.
5. **Engage Actively**: Complete the challenge above and share your paragraph with me. I’ll provide specific feedback to refine your usage, ensuring you feel confident applying “resist” in essays or conversations.

By combining these strategies, you’ll not only memorize “resist” but also wield it effectively in academic writing, casual speech, and cross-cultural discussions.
